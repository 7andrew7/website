	FAQ:
	<ul>
			<li>What's with all the antennas?
			<p> These computers are equipped with the state of the art wireless
			network interface chips that implement a draft of the new IEEE
			802.11n standard for next-generation high-throughput wireless
			networking. The focus of this standard is multi-antenna
			communication. The use of multiple antennas adds reliability,
			improves range, <i>and</i> can increase the speed of a link
			proportional to the number of antennas in the best case.
			</p>
			</li>

			<li>Do these cards emit dangerous levels of radiation?

			<p>No. Although the computers have more (visible) antennas than you
			may be used to, the amount of power transmitted is no more than
			that emitted by your laptop or iPhone wireless, and is much less
			than that of your CDMA or GSM cell phone connection, or microwave.
			Also, the testbed is typically idle during the day. Don't
			worry.</p>
			</li>

			<li>Does the testbed interfere with normal wireless usage in the
			Allen Center?

			<p>No. We operate our testbed on an unused channel in the 5.2 GHz
			frequency band. At the time of deployment, no CSE, UW, or EE access
			points share this frequency.</p>
			</li>

			<li>What wireless activity does the testbed measure and/or record?

			<p>We are interested in understanding how well the new 802.11n
			wireless works and developing novel algorithms, methods,
			techniques, etcetera. We mainly measure the physical scattering
			properties of wireless links within CSE over time and space. We do
			<i>not</i> record any identifying information about any
			transmissions that are not both from and to our testbed nodes. In
			addition, as no service-providing access points operate on the
			wireless channel we use, no personal traffic other than scanning
			for access points should ever even be overheard (and subsequently
			not recorded) by our testbed.</p>
			</li>

			<li>What is the extent of the testbed?

			<p>At the time of writing, there are eleven nodes on the third
			floor of the Allen Center. Their locations are depicted in the
			image below.
